         <p class="about-speaker">Riccardo Iaconelli is the founder of WikiToLearn and a KDE developer. He contributed his first patches to the project at the age of 14. He moved his first steps in the open source world at the age of 13 within FSFE and never stopped. He counts in his portfolio important collaborations with entities such as CERN or INFN â€“ his multidisciplinary background made him popular for achievements in both software development and graphic design.

Riccardo has always kept an eye on all kind of technologies that made Qt based software appealing to users, using much of the experience he accumulated within the Oxygen project. He was also one of the core developers of Plasma since the very first days. His last project, to which he gave birth, is WikiToLearn, a web platform dedicated to the creation and exploitation of free scientific knowledge.

He co-founded Ispirata, a company providing services and products built around KDE and Qt technologies, and left it one year after. He has been working with CERN and other research institutions since then.</p>
